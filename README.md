## Tips and Tricks

- Check the Recent Conversions table to compare multiple amounts without re-entering data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Input Error**
   - **Problem**: "Please enter a valid positive number" message appears
   - **Solution**: Ensure you've entered only numbers (and optionally a decimal point) in the amount field, and that the value is greater than zero

2. **Same Currency Selected**
   - **Problem**: Converting between the same currency (e.g., USD to USD)
   - **Solution**: The amount will remain unchanged, as no actual conversion is needed

3. **Conversion Failed**
   - **Problem**: "Conversion failed. Please try again." message appears
   - **Solution**: Check your internet connection and try again. If the problem persists, the currency service may be temporarily unavailable
